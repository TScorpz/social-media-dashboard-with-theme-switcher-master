## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to create a theme for my website and a switch theme button.
Another new thing I learned while doing this project was `window.localStorage` to store a theme chosen by user and set it back on page reload.

### Continued development

In future projects I want to make switching themes smoother.
